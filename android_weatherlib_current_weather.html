<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this paragraph we will see how to get current weather conditions.
Weatherlib helps you to get weather condition<br>
creating weather data model indipendently from the weather provider you
used.<br>
You can query the current weather condition using city id, retrieved
using search city, or using latitude and longitude. The library will
check the way you are querying the condition and choses the right
remote service to invoke.<br>
Notice that city id has the precedence respect to geo coords, so if you
create a request, using <code>WeatherRequest</code>, holding both
information, the
library will select the city id to create the query.<br>
<br>
The <em>Current weather</em> features is supported by:<br/><br/>
    <table class="table_support">
      <tr> 
        <td><strong>Openweathermap</strong></td>
        <td><font class="ok_support">Yes</font></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Weatherunderground<br/>Weather.com</strong></td>
         <td><font class="ok_support">Yes</font></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Yahoo! Weather</strong></td>
        <td><font class="ok_support">Yes</font></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Forecast.io</strong></td>
         <td><font class="ok_support">Yes</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<h2>Get current weather by city id</h2>
If you want to get current weather condition using city id, first you
have to create the WeatherRequest:<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">WeatherRequest req = new WeatherRequest(cityId);<br></pre>
<br>
Now we have the request, we can query the current weather. As always, our
weatherClient object must be correctly instantiated and configured.
The method to use to get the weather is:
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">   weatherClient.getCurrentCondition(req, new WeatherClient.WeatherEventListener() {<br>            @Override<br>            public void onWeatherRetrieved(CurrentWeather cWeather) {<br>                Weather weather = cWeather.weather;<br>		// The weather condition object is ready and we can use it <br>           }<br><br>            @Override<br>            public void onWeatherError(WeatherLibException t) {<br>                // Something went wrong maybe we should inform the user<br>            }<br><br>            @Override<br>            public void onConnectionError(Throwable t) {<br>               // There was a connection error<br>            }<br>        });<br></pre>
<br>
<br>
As you can see it is very simple, we have to provide a listener so that we get informed
when the weather data is ready.
<br>
The <code>onWeatherRetrieved(CurrentWeather cWeather)</code> is called as soon as the data
is ready. <br/>
We can use <em>CurrentWeather</em> to get the <strong>current weather condition</strong>. 
This class holds <em>WeatherUnit</em> that is filled with the unit measure system retrieved
from the <strong>weather provider</strong>.
<em>Weather</em> class hold all the information about current weather.
Weather is built as:
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Weather {
    public Location location = new Location();
    public Condition currentCondition = new Condition();
    public Temperature temperature = new Temperature();
    public Wind wind = new Wind();
    public Rain[] rain = {new Rain(), new Rain()};
    public Snow snow = new Snow();
    public Clouds clouds = new Clouds();
..
}
</pre>
<br/>
As you can see there are all <strong>weather information in the Android app</strong>
<br/>
For example, in the <code>onWeatherRetrieved</code> in your <strong>Android weather app</strong>, you
should fill your <strong>Android UI app</strong>:
<pre class="prettyprint">
weatherClient.getCurrentCondition(req, new WeatherClient.WeatherEventListener() {
            @Override
            public void onWeatherRetrieved(CurrentWeather cWeather) {
                Weather weather = cWeather.weather;
                getListener().requestCompleted();
                cityText.setText(weather.location.getCity() + "," + weather.location.getCountry());
                condDescr.setText(weather.currentCondition.getCondition() + "(" + weather.currentCondition.getDescr() + ")");
                LogUtils.LOGD("SwA", "Temp [" + temp + "]");
                LogUtils.LOGD("SwA", "Val [" + weather.temperature.getTemp() + "]");
                temp.setText("" + ((int) weather.temperature.getTemp()));
                unitTemp.setText(cWeather.getUnit().tempUnit);
                colorTextLine.setBackgroundResource(WeatherUtil.getResource(weather.temperature.getTemp(), config));
                hum.setText(weather.currentCondition.getHumidity() + "%");
                tempMin.setText(weather.temperature.getMinTemp() + cWeather.getUnit().tempUnit);
                tempMax.setText(weather.temperature.getMaxTemp() + cWeather.getUnit().tempUnit);
                windSpeed.setText(weather.wind.getSpeed() + cWeather.getUnit().speedUnit);
                windDeg.setText((int) weather.wind.getDeg() + "Â° (" + WindDirection.getDir((int) weather.wind.getDeg()) + ")");
                press.setText(weather.currentCondition.getPressure() + cWeather.getUnit().pressureUnit);

                sunrise.setText(WeatherUtil.convertDate(weather.location.getSunrise()));

                sunset.setText(WeatherUtil.convertDate(weather.location.getSunset()));
                ....
             }
}
</pre>
<br/>
You should notice, that some fields could be null depending on the <em>weather provider</em>.
